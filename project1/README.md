# Clone WebPage
Since I am fairly new to HTML & CSS and I have been learning the syntax a little bit, this is the best time for me to put things into practice.

In this project, I clone various HTML pages.

Here is a list of the pages:
1. [Python Projects - Beginner to Advanced](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-projects-beginner-to-advanced/) from GeeksforGeeks. - just trying to get something going.
2. [Quotes to scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com). - also trying to get something going. But with a little more knowledge.
