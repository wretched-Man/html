# DOM Familiarity in JavaScript

I believed that it was important for me to get somewhat familiar with the Javascript DOM.

Hence, I built the very basic calculator and a Tic-tac-toe game.

There is more to be learnt in the (unwinnable) game than in the calculator.

With this basic introduction to the DOM and JavaScript, I can now go on and try my hand on a more challenging web application.
